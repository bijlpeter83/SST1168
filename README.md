Age model published in Hou et al. In brief we interpolated a LOESS smooth fit through biostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data (Stickley et al., 2004) which were updated to GTS2020 using Nannotax and FORAMTAX. Extra weight was put on magnetostratigraphic tie points.

For all data we used the Bayesian calibrations of Tierney and Tingley, 2015 and Tierney and Tingley 2018
BAYSPAR with prior mean of 20 and prior stdev of 20
BAYSPLINE with prior stdev of 10
